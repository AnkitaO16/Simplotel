# Simplotel Frontend Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains the frontend implementation for the Simplotel assignment. It demonstrates a simple hotel-related web page structure using HTML, CSS, and assets.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Folder structure for assets (images, icons, etc.)

## Project Structure

Simplotel/
├── assets/       # Images, icons, and other static assets
├── home.html     # Main HTML page
└── main.css      # Stylesheet for the page


## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnkitaO16/Simplotel.git

2. Open `home.html` in a web browser.

## Notes

* The project is a basic frontend assignment and does not include backend functionality.
* Styling is minimal and focuses on layout and structure.

```

I can also **add a very short “About the Assignment” section** to highlight the purpose technically, if you want. Do you want me to do that?
